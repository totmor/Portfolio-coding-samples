Here a some few examples made with c# Object oriented programming , to open with visual studio.
Also are examples of projects with VS code HTML, Javascript, and Bootstrap. thes apss are old an not maintained well so there is just the code examples.
Other not working examples with android studio and asp.net I have not shown because the files are to big. They should be debugged cuz they are old apps.
A lot of coding has happenned since I started in 2018 . with scratch. and 2019 with C# ...
